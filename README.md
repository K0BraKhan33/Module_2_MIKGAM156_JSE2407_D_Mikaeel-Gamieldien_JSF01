#ALPINE.JS Challange

In this challange, I demonstrate my understanding of Alpine.js using a Fakestore Api (https://fakestoreapi.com/) to demonstrate my understanding of Api usage, tailwind css, and Alpine text replacment instead of standered Html coding. 

this project is an e-commerce website, where the user can see the products with rating, sorting and a larger view with a detailed subsription and using url lins it stirs the sorting functions
